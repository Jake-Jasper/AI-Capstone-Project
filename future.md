## Lessons learned - what I would do next time

- Create synthetic questions - hundreds... from document chunks

- Track metrics for each query e.g. cosine distance in order to track difficult questions.

- Do full text search as well appraently will [improve system](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/05/11/low-hanging-fruit-for-rag-search/#4-tracking-average-cosine-distance-and-cohere-reranking-score)

- Add meta data from docuements (have seen other systems do this e.g. H20GPT)
