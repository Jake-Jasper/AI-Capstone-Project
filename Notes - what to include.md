## Lit review due 26th May - things to write about

First, you need to identify at least ten relevant scholarly publications including academic journals, conference papers and verified articles on your topic.

They want us to use keywords so, basically it is a systematic literature review. pick 10 papers and review them...

- LLMs and general embedding
- text extration and nlp - striping the text from the reports may be an issue

Survey of alternatives
- I guess this would be fine-tuning a model to embed knowledge...
- Can't really think of any alternatives. Obviously buying off the shelf stuff but ot doing that.
- Maybe it is talking about models and databases?

## Scientific method

Hyothesis testing - test models versus each other and see what if there are any significant differences. This will be difficult with LLms - confer with supervisors.
